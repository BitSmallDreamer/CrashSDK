1. get ip(instruction pointer) where program crashed.
2. search all lib in loaded in current process, using dl_iterate_phdr, find the target lib in which the ip located.
3. find exactly which FDE in which the ip located, and restore call frame by CIE&FDE instructions.
4. after restoring call frame we can find the return address.
5. the return address is in the caller, so we unwind the caller stack with the return address.
